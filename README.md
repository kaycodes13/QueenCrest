# Crest of the Queen

A custom crest themed around The White Lady for Hollow Knight: Silksong.

This is a mod I made for a friend which combines parts of several base game crests into their ideal crest. Two skill slots, ample blue slots, the balanced moveset of Hunter, the powerful silk gain of Reaper, and the multi-hitting needle strike of Witch.

The moveset itself is already fully functional. Custom animations may be added in the future.

## Installation

Install via r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager. QueenCrest's dependencies should be installed automatically.

For manual installation, extract the .zip file and place the **folder** containing QueenCrest.dll in the BepInEx/plugins directory for your Silksong install.

## Usage

Once the mod is installed, loading into any save file will automatically unlock the new crest. Just equip it and you're good to go.

Note that this mod affects your save data and adds an extra percentage point to game completion. Back up your saves before use.
